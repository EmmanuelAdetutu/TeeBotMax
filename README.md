TeeBotMax
=========


This is TeeBotMax printed parts (all STL files).

<b>TeeBotMax is a RepRap printer.</b><br> 
The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Foldarap and Prusa I3 3D printers. I needed a 3D printer I can fold and carry around easily.
The Idea was to develop a 3D printer which is simple to build and at the same time, easy to move around and travel with, built with simple materials and equally strong and precise.

<b>TeeBot suitcase 3D printer.</b><br>
The second iteration of the design resulted in a version that fits and works in a suitcase!! the project was successfully funded via kickstater (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/99905999/teebot-the-suitcase-3d-printer)

Version2
