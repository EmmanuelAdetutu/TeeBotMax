TeeBotMax
=========

The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Foldarap and Prusa I3 3D printers. I needed a 3D printer I can fold and carry around easily.
The idea was to develop a high qiality 3D printer which is simple to build and at the same time, easy to move around and travel with, built with simple materials and equally strong and precise.
